Wordpress plugin to add Category Specific RSS feed subscription menu to your posts, pages and sidebar.

== Description ==
This WordPress Plugin allows you to present a menu with multiple RSS feed subscription option to your site's visitors in addition to your normal RSS subscription option.

If your site covers multiple topics then your subscribed readers may get annoyed when you update your site with content that they are not interested in and they get a notification in their RSS reader.

I found that most of the time I never subscribe to a site's RSS feed when it doesn't have the topic/category specific subscription option, specially when the site covers multiple topics cause I don't like to be hammered with all the unwanted content updates.

This plugin allows you to configure up to 8 different topic specific RSS feeds.
